# How data is stored?  An introduction to tables.

## introduction

Data is the heart of a Database.  SQL Databases model data in the form of tables.  We will explore what a table is in this chapter.  We will do so without engaging in SQL.  I want to first develop a sense for data and tables.  Then we can worry about learning SQL and focusing on memorizing syntax.  That alone can be a time intensive task.  By building context about data and databases, SQL should come easier.  In the end of the day, we manage databases, because we value data.

In this course, I will use Toyota as an example.  We will explore how Toyota manufactures cars and distributes them.  To do this, we will look at data in this chapter.  The next chapter will be about generating that data.  The last chapter will involve moving data, using it in business reports and analying the data for senior management.

Note, during this process I do not follow best practices.  Instead, we simplify these processes and add them as context while learning SQL.  Most of these professions require extensive training.
