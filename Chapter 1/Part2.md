# Understanding Tables

## Introduction

In the previous section, we dicussed Tables.  Tables are just datasets.  Tables can have relationships between each other through the concept of Foreign keys.  In the next four sections, we discuss a concept called CRUD.  It stands for: Create, Read, Update and Delete.  CRUD is a reference to external applications that manipulate SQL Databases.  Specifically, they manipulate or read data off of the tables we mentioned in the previous section.

This section will specifically deal with the C in CRUD, which is how to create data.  Most CRUD operations insert a few rows of data into a table at a time.  An alternative method for inserting data into a table is called bulk insert or batch processing.  This is a procedure used when loading large external datasets into a table.

We will explain CRUD first.  Then bulk inserts later
