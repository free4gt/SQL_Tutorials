# Database and SQL Tutorial

This course will emphasize two topics: Structured Query Language (SQL) and Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).  SQL is a computer programming language that allows us to interact with databases.  RDBMS almost exclusively uses SQL for most operations.  RDBMS are almost ubiquitous in industry.  They have been associated with SQL since their inception in 1979 (Oracle v2).  For this reason, most RDBMS are called SQL Databases in industry.  We will use this shorthand in this course.  That said RDBMS are not the only systems or databases that use SQL.  SQL has become so popular that it has transcended it's RDBMS origins and can be found in many unexpected places.  All of this will be explained in later lessons.

## Course Overview

Counterintuitively, I will not mention any SQL in the first three chapters.  I want the audience to have an intuition for how SQL databases are used without focusing on computer language syntax.  This will help the audience understand why SQL databases are used and what type of operations are common to SQL databases.  Hopefully, this will provide more context when writing SQL itself.  The first chapter will talk about how datasets are built.  The second chapter will talk about how databases are used to answer business questions.  The 3rd chapter will talk about what a SQL database actually is.  This chapter will be dedicated to talking about what a computer is and what a SQL database looks like under the cover.  I provide this "look" into database as software to prevent the feeling that you are working with a black box.  Chapter 4 and beyond will focus on translating the first two chapters into SQL statements.  These sections really benefit from dedicated practice.
