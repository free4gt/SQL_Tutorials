# SQL and SQL Database (RDBMS) Tutorial

## Introduction

This course will cover SQL - Structured Query Language.  SQL is a computer language that allows you to interact with databases.  Not all databases use SQL.  It's easily the most common by a wide margin.  It's probably used by at least 95% of companies (if not more).

For this tutorial, we will focus on Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).  I would say almost all RDBMS use SQL.  I can't think of one that doesn't.  For this reason, RDBMS are often referred to as SQL databases.  We will use this shorthand during this course (RDBMS are not the only SQL Databases, but they are easily the most common).  I might cover other databases or technologies when discussing data analysis.

## Course Overview

This course is taught by going through real world processes and showing how SQL and SQL Databases fit into that process.  The content covered is listed below:

| Step             | Description                                                                     |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Set-up           | We install a SQL Database                                                       |
| Tables           | We discuss how data is represented in a SQL database                            |
| Data Generation  | We discuss data creation and generate a dataset                                 |
| Modifying Data   | We discuss modifying data and deleting data                                     |
| Analyzing Data   | We discuss viewing and analyzing data                                           |

During this course, I will show a simplified view of how different teams use SQL Databases.  We will discuss tasks typically associated with: 

* Software Engineer managing a Web Application
* Call center employee using a user form
* Data Engineer moving data between two systems
* Business Intelligence Developer generating data insights reports
* Business Analyst supporting presentations for senior executives

When discussing these roles, I might introduce topics outside of SQL Databases.  The emphasis will be how all these groups interact with the SQL Database.

Data in this course will be modeled on a Car Manufacturer.  I'm no expert on this domain.  It represents a real world object and system.  That makes it practical.
